 how to model a ride from a to b and determine the current location of vehicles. Write a brief explanation of your ideas.
 
 We have to create a location object to store location. Use GPS to get location of driver of available car (when driver is in car). 
 Every car will have an approximatelocation x,y co-ordinates.
 To model ride from a to b, we will try to find any available car within few radius from a point. When a car is found, then we will set a driver object to drive it to b location. Drive path will be find out using shortest path algorithm.
